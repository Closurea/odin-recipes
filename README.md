# odin-recipes
An HTML project from the odin project Website ( recipes site )

Currently im comfortable with HTML.

Im gonna create a website that contains different persian food recipes
that each food recipe has its own tab and a main (index) page.
I will use some pictures (probably PNG) and some descriptions on how to make those food.

I won't use any CSS or Javascript

currently i only have a basic knowledge on HTML and a little CSS
